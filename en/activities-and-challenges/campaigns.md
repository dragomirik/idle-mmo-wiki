# Campaigns

Campaigns in IdleMMO provide a completely free no strings attached battle pass experience, letting players earn various rewards like tokens and exclusive skins. There are two main types of campaigns to engage with:

#### Global Campaigns

- These are the main campaigns of IdleMMO, accessible at any time. They do not expire.
- Global campaigns offer a variety of rewards, including exclusive skins, tokens, and other in-game items.

**Pro Tip:** Don't worry about missing out; you can revisit any previous global campaign at your leisure.

#### Seasonal Campaigns

- These campaigns are tied to seasonal events like Halloween, Winter Holidays, Easter, and Valentine's Day, and they are available only for a limited time.
- Once a seasonal campaign ends, you cannot access it again.

**Features of Seasonal Campaigns:**
- They offer unique rewards and skills pertinent to the season.
- For instance, in the `Eve of Shadows` campaign, you can collect `Pumpkins` and exchange them for `Campaign Points` and rewards.
- These collectibles are acquired through skill-based activities, but first, your character must venture to the event-specific location, available only during the campaign.

**Pro Tip:** Maximize your Campaign Points in the seasonal events by focusing on tasks that demand more attention. 

Building a `Snowman`, for instance, yields higher points compared to simple `Snowball` trading. This is by design, as activities requiring greater effort, like gathering materials for `Snowman`, are more rewarding in the campaign. Keep in mind, the extra effort pays off in a substantial points boost!
